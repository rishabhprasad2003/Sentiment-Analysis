# Sentiment-Analysis

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; using NLTK library from python. Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone or polarity of a piece of text, which in this case, will be customer reviews.
Customer Reviews were web scraped using Beautifulsoup library in pyhton form website - https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways/page/1/  into a pandas Dataframe.


By analyzing these reviews, we got insights into customer opinions and reactions, which can be invaluable for making business decisions, improving products or services, and enhancing customer satisfaction.
